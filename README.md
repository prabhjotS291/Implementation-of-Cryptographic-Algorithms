# 🔐 Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms

A modular Python implementation and performance benchmarking framework for comparing multiple cryptographic algorithms.

This project implements and evaluates the following encryption algorithms:

- AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- DNA-Based Encryption
- Logistic Map Based Chaotic Encryption

The project was developed as part of a cryptography research internship and focuses on comparing the performance and security characteristics of different encryption techniques.
